# Information-Theory-Project
This is our final project in the course "Information Theory" by prof. Reuven Cohen in Bar Ilan University.

Our work includes an implementation of three compression methods: PPM, Huffman coding and Zip, that were all been used on the "dickens.txt" file that is attached in this repository. Full explanations and a comparison between these three methods can be found in the file "Analysis.pdf".

How to use:

PPM: For compression please go to the file "ppm_compress.py", For decompression please go to the file "ppm_decompress.py". All running
instructions can be found in there.

Huffman coding: Both compression and decompression running instructions can be found in the file "Huffman.py".

Zip: Both compression and decompression running instructions can be found in the file "zip_compression.py".

The rest of the files are being used in the main files that were mentioned above. All files are well documented.

For any feedback or problem, please refer to us in one of these three mail addresses: 123shovalf@gmail.com, zoharyakobi7@gmail.com or kfirsalo@gmail.com .
